With these domains typically being power-constrained and event-based while requiring low latency, neuromorphic algorithms in the form of spiking neural networks (SNNs) have great potential. Yet, current effective SNN solutions require a contextual sampling window imposing substantial latency, typically around 32ms, too long for many applications. Inspired by Dual-Path Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNNs) in classical neural networks, we develop a two-phase time-domain streaming SNN framework -- the Dual-Path Spiking Neural Network (DPSNN). In the DPSNN, the first phase uses Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNNs) to capture global contextual information, while the second phase uses Spiking Recurrent Neural Networks (SRNNs) to focus on frequency-related features. In addition, the regularizer suppresses activation to further enhance energy efficiency of our DPSNNs. Evaluating on the VCTK and Intel DNS Datasets, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the very low latency (approximately 5ms) required for applications like hearing aids, while demonstrating excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), perceptual quality, and energy efficiency.</details>|Tao Sun, Sander Boht√©|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07388v1), [Code](#)
2024-08-14|Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation|<details><summary>...</summary>Efficient implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such neuromorphic systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. As a promising advancement, a computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism experienced a recent upswing in popularity, caused by demonstrations of its superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however, is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. We find that the frequently observed stability problems during training of such networks can be overcome by applying an alternative discretization method that results in provably better stability properties than the commonly used Euler-Forward method. With this discretization, we achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on common event-based benchmark datasets. We also show that the superiority of networks of adaptive LIF neurons extends to the prediction and generation of complex time series. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences. Furthermore, these networks are surprisingly robust to shifts of the mean input strength and input spike rate, even when these shifts were not observed during training. As a consequence, high-performance networks can be obtained without any normalization techniques such as batch normalization or batch-normalization through time.</details>|Maximilian Baronig, Romain Ferrand, Silvester Sabathiel, Robert Legenstein|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v1), [Code](https://github.com/IGITUGraz/SE-adlif)
2024-08-14|Analog Spiking Neuron in CMOS 28 nm Towards Large-Scale Neuromorphic Processors|<details><summary>...</summary>The computational complexity of deep learning algorithms has given rise to significant speed and memory challenges for the execution hardware. In energy-limited portable devices, highly efficient processing platforms are indispensable for reproducing the prowess afforded by much bulkier processing platforms.   In this work, we present a low-power Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron design fabricated in TSMC's 28 nm CMOS technology as proof of concept to build an energy-efficient mixed-signal Neuromorphic System-on-Chip (NeuroSoC). The fabricated neuron consumes 1.61 fJ/spike and occupies an active area of 34 $\mu m^{2}$, leading to a maximum spiking frequency of 300 kHz at 250 mV power supply.   These performances are used in a software model to emulate the dynamics of a Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Employing supervised backpropagation and a surrogate gradient technique, the resulting accuracy on the MNIST dataset, using 4-bit post-training quantization stands at 82.5\%. The approach underscores the potential of such ASIC implementation of quantized SNNs to deliver high-performance, energy-efficient solutions to various embedded machine-learning applications.</details>|Marwan Besrour, Jacob Lavoie, Takwa Omrani, Gabriel Martin-Hardy, Esmaeil Ranjbar Koleibi, Jeremy Menard, Konin Koua, Philippe Marcoux, Mounir Boukadoum, Rejean Fontaine|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07734v1), [Code](#)
2024-08-16|Xpikeformer: Hybrid Analog-Digital Hardware Acceleration for Spiking Transformers|<details><summary>...</summary>This paper introduces Xpikeformer, a hybrid analog-digital hardware architecture designed to accelerate spiking neural network (SNN)-based transformer models. By combining the energy efficiency and temporal dynamics of SNNs with the powerful sequence modeling capabilities of transformers, Xpikeformer leverages mixed analog-digital computing techniques to enhance performance and energy efficiency. The architecture integrates analog in-memory computing (AIMC) for feedforward and fully connected layers, and a stochastic spiking attention (SSA) engine for efficient attention mechanisms. We detail the design, implementation, and evaluation of Xpikeformer, demonstrating significant improvements in energy consumption and computational efficiency. Through an image classification task and a wireless communication symbol detection task, we show that Xpikeformer can achieve software-comparable inference accuracy. Energy evaluations reveal that Xpikeformer achieves up to a $17.8$--$19.2\times$ reduction in energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art digital ANN transformers and up to a $5.9$--$6.8\times$ reduction compared to fully digital SNN transformers. Xpikeformer also achieves a $12.0\times$ speedup compared to the GPU implementation of spiking transformers.</details>|Zihang Song, Prabodh Katti, Osvaldo Simeone, Bipin Rajendran|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08794v1), [Code](#)
2024-08-17|Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation|<details><summary>...</summary>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low energy computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent output logits and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of spiking neurons for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only an additional temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</details>|Lin Zuo, Yongqi Ding, Wenwei Luo, Mengmeng Jing, Xianlong Tian, Kunshan Yang|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v1), [Code](#)
2024-08-18|Obtaining Optimal Spiking Neural Network in Sequence Learning via CRNN-SNN Conversion|<details><summary>...</summary>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are becoming a promising alternative to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to their rich neural dynamics and the implementation of energy-efficient neuromorphic chips. However, the non-differential binary communication mechanism makes SNN hard to converge to an ANN-level accuracy. When SNN encounters sequence learning, the situation becomes worse due to the difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies. To overcome these difficulties, researchers developed variants of LIF neurons and different surrogate gradients but still failed to obtain good results when the sequence became longer (e.g., $>$500). Unlike them, we obtain an optimal SNN in sequence learning by directly mapping parameters from a quantized CRNN. We design two sub-pipelines to support the end-to-end conversion of different structures in neural networks, which is called CNN-Morph (CNN $\rightarrow$ QCNN $\rightarrow$ BIFSNN) and RNN-Morph (RNN $\rightarrow$ QRNN $\rightarrow$ RBIFSNN). Using conversion pipelines and the s-analog encoding method, the conversion error of our framework is zero. Furthermore, we give the theoretical and experimental demonstration of the lossless CRNN-SNN conversion. Our results show the effectiveness of our method over short and long timescales tasks compared with the state-of-the-art learning- and conversion-based methods. We reach the highest accuracy of 99.16% (0.46 $\uparrow$) on S-MNIST, 94.95% (3.95 $\uparrow$) on PS-MNIST (sequence length of 784) respectively, and the lowest loss of 0.057 (0.013 $\downarrow$) within 8 time-steps in collision avoidance dataset.</details>|Jiahao Su, Kang You, Zekai Xu, Weizhi Xu, Zhezhi He|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09403v1), [Code](#)
2024-08-20|Towards Efficient Formal Verification of Spiking Neural Network|<details><summary>...</summary>Recently, AI research has primarily focused on large language models (LLMs), and increasing accuracy often involves scaling up and consuming more power. The power consumption of AI has become a significant societal issue; in this context, spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution. SNNs operate event-driven, like the human brain, and compress information temporally. These characteristics allow SNNs to significantly reduce power consumption compared to perceptron-based artificial neural networks (ANNs), highlighting them as a next-generation neural network technology. However, societal concerns regarding AI go beyond power consumption, with the reliability of AI models being a global issue. For instance, adversarial attacks on AI models are a well-studied problem in the context of traditional neural networks. Despite their importance, the stability and property verification of SNNs remains in the early stages of research. Most SNN verification methods are time-consuming and barely scalable, making practical applications challenging. In this paper, we introduce temporal encoding to achieve practical performance in verifying the adversarial robustness of SNNs. We conduct a theoretical analysis of this approach and demonstrate its success in verifying SNNs at previously unmanageable scales. Our contribution advances SNN verification to a practical level, facilitating the safer application of SNNs.</details>|Baekryun Seong, Jieung Kim, Sang-Ki Ko|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10900v1), [Code](#)
2024-08-17|Toward End-to-End Bearing Fault Diagnosis for Industrial Scenarios with Spiking Neural Networks|<details><summary>...</summary>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) transmit information via low-power binary spikes and have received widespread attention in areas such as computer vision and reinforcement learning. However, there have been very few explorations of SNNs in more practical industrial scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the application of SNNs in bearing fault diagnosis to facilitate the integration of high-performance AI algorithms and real-world industries. In particular, we identify two key limitations of existing SNN fault diagnosis methods: inadequate encoding capacity that necessitates cumbersome data preprocessing, and non-spike-oriented architectures that constrain the performance of SNNs. To alleviate these problems, we propose a Multi-scale Residual Attention SNN (MRA-SNN) to simultaneously improve the efficiency, performance, and robustness of SNN methods. By incorporating a lightweight attention mechanism, we have designed a multi-scale attention encoding module to extract multiscale fault features from vibration signals and encode them as spatio-temporal spikes, eliminating the need for complicated preprocessing. Then, the spike residual attention block extracts high-dimensional fault features and enhances the expressiveness of sparse spikes with the attention mechanism for end-to-end diagnosis. In addition, the performance and robustness of MRA-SNN is further enhanced by introducing the lightweight attention mechanism within the spiking neurons to simulate the biological dendritic filtering effect. Extensive experiments on MFPT and JNU benchmark datasets demonstrate that MRA-SNN significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, energy consumption and noise robustness, and is more feasible for deployment in real-world industrial scenarios.</details>|Yongqi Ding, Lin Zuo, Mengmeng Jing, Kunshan Yang, Biao Chen, Yunqian Yu|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11067v1), [Code](#)
2024-08-22|AT-SNN: Adaptive Tokens for Vision Transformer on Spiking Neural Network|<details><summary>...</summary>In the training and inference of spiking neural networks (SNNs), direct training and lightweight computation methods have been orthogonally developed, aimed at reducing power consumption. However, only a limited number of approaches have applied these two mechanisms simultaneously and failed to fully leverage the advantages of SNN-based vision transformers (ViTs) since they were originally designed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we propose AT-SNN designed to dynamically adjust the number of tokens processed during inference in SNN-based ViTs with direct training, wherein power consumption is proportional to the number of tokens. We first demonstrate the applicability of adaptive computation time (ACT), previously limited to RNNs and ViTs, to SNN-based ViTs, enhancing it to discard less informative spatial tokens selectively. Also, we propose a new token-merge mechanism that relies on the similarity of tokens, which further reduces the number of tokens while enhancing accuracy. We implement AT-SNN to Spikformer and show the effectiveness of AT-SNN in achieving high energy efficiency and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches on the image classification tasks, CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet. For example, our approach uses up to 42.4% fewer tokens than the existing best-performing method on CIFAR-100, while conserving higher accuracy.</details>|Donghwa Kang, Youngmoon Lee, Eun-Kyu Lee, Brent Kang, Jinkyu Lee, Hyeongboo Baek|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12293v1), [Code](#)
2024-08-22|Adaptive Spiking Neural Networks with Hybrid Coding|<details><summary>...</summary>The Spiking Neural Network (SNN), due to its unique spiking-driven nature, is a more energy-efficient and effective neural network compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The encoding method directly influences the overall performance of the network, and currently, direct encoding is primarily used for directly trained SNNs. When working with static image datasets, direct encoding inputs the same feature map at every time step, failing to fully exploit the spatiotemporal properties of SNNs. While temporal encoding converts input data into spike trains with spatiotemporal characteristics, traditional SNNs utilize the same neurons when processing input data across different time steps, limiting their ability to integrate and utilize spatiotemporal information effectively.To address this, this paper employs temporal encoding and proposes the Adaptive Spiking Neural Network (ASNN), enhancing the utilization of temporal encoding in conventional SNNs. Additionally, temporal encoding is less frequently used because short time steps can lead to significant loss of input data information, often necessitating a higher number of time steps in practical applications. However, training large SNNs with long time steps is challenging due to hardware constraints. To overcome this, this paper introduces a hybrid encoding approach that not only reduces the required time steps for training but also continues to improve the overall network performance.Notably, significant improvements in classification performance are observed on both Spikformer and Spiking ResNet architectures.our code is available at https://github.com/hhx0320/ASNN</details>|Huaxu He|[PDF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12407v1), [Code](https://github.com/hhx0320/asnn)
